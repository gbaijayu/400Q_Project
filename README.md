Please develop the code and all other materials in a shared (private) GitHub repo. The structure of the implementation is largely left to you, however your code/repo should contain:

A README which outlines any requirements and dependencies
Instructions detailing how to run the code and reproduce any tables/plots in your presentation and report
Full documentation (docstrings as well as inline comments)
A statement explaining the contributions of each group member
After the course ends, your group is welcome to make your project public.
